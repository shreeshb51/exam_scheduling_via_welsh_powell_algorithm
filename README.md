# Exam Scheduling via Welsh Powell Algorithm

## Project Description

A Streamlit web application that solves the exam scheduling problem using graph coloring techniques. This tool helps educational institutions optimize their examination timetables by scheduling exams in the minimum number of days while ensuring no student has multiple exams on the same day. The application uses the Welsh Powell Algorithm (a greedy graph coloring approach) to find an efficient solution to this classic constraint satisfaction problem.

## Methodology

### Problem Formulation

The exam scheduling problem can be formally defined as follows:

1. **Input**:
   - A set of courses C = {c₁, c₂, ..., cₙ}
   - A set of students S = {s₁, s₂, ..., sₘ}
   - A registration matrix R where R[i,j] = 1 if student sᵢ is registered for course cⱼ, and 0 otherwise

2. **Constraints**:
   - No student should have multiple exams scheduled on the same day
   - Each course must be scheduled for exactly one day

3. **Objective**:
   - Minimize the number of days required to schedule all exams

4. **Graph Representation**:
   - Courses are represented as vertices in an undirected graph G = (V, E)
   - An edge (cᵢ, cⱼ) exists if there is at least one student registered for both courses cᵢ and cⱼ
   - This creates a "conflict graph" where connected vertices (courses) cannot be scheduled on the same day

### Welsh Powell Algorithm

The Welsh Powell algorithm is a greedy approach to graph coloring that follows these steps:

1. **Order the vertices** by degree (number of connections) in descending order: V' = {v₁, v₂, ..., vₙ} where degree(vᵢ) ≥ degree(vᵢ₊₁)

2. **Assign the first color** (Day 1):
   - Color the first vertex v₁
   - Iterate through the remaining vertices in order
   - Color each vertex that is not adjacent to any previously colored vertex with the same color

3. **Repeat with a new color** for the remaining uncolored vertices until all vertices are colored

4. **The number of colors used** (equal to the highest color index assigned) represents the chromatic number of the graph, which corresponds to the minimum number of days required for scheduling

### Process Flow

The application follows this detailed process flow:

1. **Data Collection**:
   - Gather student course registrations through the user interface
   - Construct the conflict graph based on shared course enrollments

2. **Initial Schedule Generation**:
   - Apply the Welsh Powell algorithm to the conflict graph
   - Determine the chromatic number (minimum required days)
   - Assign each course to its corresponding day based on its color

3. **Visualization**:
   - Render the conflict graph with color-coded nodes
   - Display the initial schedule in a tabular format

4. **Schedule Refinement**:
   - Enable manual adjustments through the interactive editor
   - Validate modifications against the original constraints
   - Highlight conflicts for resolution

5. **Finalization**:
   - Export the validated schedule to CSV format
   - Provide visual confirmation of successful scheduling

## Examples

### Sample Input

1. Set number of students to 2
2. For Student 1, select: Math, Physics, Computer Science
3. For Student 2, select: Physics, Chemistry, Biology

### Expected Output

- A schedule with minimum days (typically 2 days in this example)
- Day 1: Math, Chemistry, Biology
- Day 2: Physics, Computer Science

## Algorithms/Mathematical Concepts Used

### Graph Coloring Theory

- **Chromatic Number**: The minimum number of colors needed to color a graph such that no adjacent vertices share the same color. Mathematically denoted as χ(G) for a graph G.
  - In our application: The minimum number of days required for exam scheduling

- **Independent Set**: A set of vertices in a graph where no two vertices are adjacent
  - In our application: Courses that can be scheduled on the same day

- **Vertex Degree**: The number of edges connected to a vertex
  - In our application: The number of conflicts a course has with other courses

### Welsh Powell Algorithm (Detailed)

1. **Initialization**:
   - Let G = (V, E) be the conflict graph
   - Let n be the number of vertices |V|
   - Let C = {} be the set of colors assigned

2. **Vertex Ordering**:
   - Sort vertices by degree in descending order: V' = {v₁, v₂, ..., vₙ} 
   - Where degree(vᵢ) ≥ degree(vᵢ₊₁) for all i ∈ {1, 2, ..., n-1}

3. **Coloring Process**:
   - For each color k = 0, 1, 2, ... until all vertices are colored:
     - Initialize set S = {}
     - For each uncolored vertex v in V' (in order):
       - If v is not adjacent to any vertex in S:
         - Add v to S
         - Assign color k to v: C(v) = k
     - Increment k

4. **Result**:
   - The number of colors used is max(C) + 1
   - The coloring C maps each vertex to its assigned color

### Time Complexity Analysis

- **Sorting vertices by degree**: O(|V|·log|V|)
- **Coloring process**: O(|V|²)
- **Overall worst-case time complexity**: O(|V|²)
  - Where |V| is the number of vertices (courses)
